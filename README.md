Real-Time Monitoring: Track and visualize utility usage (electricity, water, gas) in real-time with interactive dashboards.

**Advanced Analytics:** Utilize machine learning algorithms to analyze usage patterns and predict future consumption, helping users make informed decisions.

**Automated Alerts:** Receive notifications for anomalies, maintenance schedules, and payment reminders via email or SMS.

**User Management:** Secure user authentication and profile management with role-based access control.

**Scalable Architecture:** Designed for scalability and performance using Spring Boot, Hibernate, and SQL Server.

**Responsive Frontend:** Built with React.js for a dynamic, user-friendly interface.

### ðŸ›  Technologies Used

**Backend Technologies**

**Java Spring Framework**

**Spring Boot:** Simplifies the development and deployment of the backend services with minimal configuration.
**Main Application Class:** SmartUtilityManagementSystemApplication.java - The entry point for the Spring Boot application, initializing and configuring the application context.
**Spring Data JPA:** Provides an abstraction for data access and integrates seamlessly with Hibernate for ORM (Object-Relational Mapping).

**Repositories:**
**UserRepository.java** - Handles data operations related to user entities.
**UtilityUsageRepository.java** - Manages database interactions for utility usage records.

**Hibernate ORM**

**Object-Relational Mapping:** Facilitates the mapping of Java objects to database tables, easing database interactions and transactions.
**Configuration:** application.properties - Contains Hibernate settings and database connection details.

**SQL Server**

**Database Management:** Manages data persistence with advanced relational database features.
**Schema Definition:** schema.sql - Defines the structure of the database, including tables and relationships.
**Triggers:** triggers.sql - Contains SQL triggers for automating data management tasks and maintaining data integrity.
**Initial Data:** data.sql - Populates the database with sample data for initial setup and testing.

**Frontend Technologies**

**React.js**
User Interface: Builds a responsive and dynamic frontend, enhancing user interaction with modern JavaScript features.
Source Code: Located in the frontend directory, includes components and state management files that drive the user interface and application behavior.

**Build Tools**

**Maven**

**Build Management:** Handles project dependencies and build processes, ensuring a smooth development workflow.
**Configuration:** pom.xml - Manages project dependencies, plugins, and build configurations for the backend application.

**npm**

**Frontend Dependency Management:** Manages JavaScript libraries and tools necessary for the frontend development.
**Configuration:** package.json - Lists frontend dependencies and scripts for building and running the React.js application (if applicable).
